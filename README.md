# WHY ðŸŒ³
**Welcome to the Holy Yggdrasil**

You wake up in what looks like a dungeon.
You aren't hurt\*, but you feel like this isn't where you should be...
WHY are you there?

\*: at least, not yet...


## Compiling
This is an SBT project, but you don't need to install sbt on your machine.
To compile, simply run
```bash
./sbt compile
```

You can also run sbt's shell with `./sbt` and then execute commands like
`compile`, `test`, etc.

## Warning: experimental Scala version
Because it's fun to learn new things (and because I'm a contributor),
this project doesn't use Scala 2.x but Dotty, an experimental research project
that will become Scala 3, the next major version of scala.

Please see [the Dotty website](https://dotty.epfl.ch) for more information.
